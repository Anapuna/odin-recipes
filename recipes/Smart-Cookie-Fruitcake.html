        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 orange, zested</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>baking spray</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted mixed nuts, chopped</li><br>

        For the Top:
        <li>1 fluid ounce spiced rum, or to taste</li>
        <li>tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dates, cherries, raisins, blueberries, apricots, and ginger in a bowl. Pour spiced rum and chai on top and let soak 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Mix soaked fruit with orange juice, zest, butter, sugar, zest, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a simmer and cook until butter has melted and sugar has dissolved, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, combine flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 4 mini loaf pans with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Remove cinnamon stick from the soaked fruit; stir in the flour mixture until combined. Add eggs, mixing to combine, and fold in mixed nuts. Divide batter between the prepared loaf pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife along the edges of each loaf and turn out of the pan. Brush warm cakes with more rum and let cool completely, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Place cooled cakes in airtight containers and store in the refrigerator for 6 to 7 weeks. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
